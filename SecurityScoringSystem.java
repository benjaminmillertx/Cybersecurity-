Make sure to credit Benjamin Hunter Miller.Here is an application of how you can create a security scoring system for a Windows operating system in Java, including all 7 steps:

1. **Identify the vulnerabilities**:

```
public enum Vulnerability {
  MISSING_PATCHES,
  UNSECURED_SETTINGS,
  WEAK_PASSWORDS,
  OPEN_PORTS,
  ACTIVE_SERVICES,
  UNKNOWN_APPLICATIONS,
  MALWARE
}
```

2. **Create a scoring system**:

```
public class Score {
  private double missingPatches = 0.0;
  private double unsecuredSettings = 0.0;
  private double weakPasswords = 0.0;
  private double openPorts = 0.0;
  private double activeServices = 0.0;
  private double unknownApplications = 0.0;
  private double malware = 0.0;
  private double total = 0.0;

  public Score() {
    missingPatches = 0.0;
    unsecuredSettings = 0.0;
    weakPasswords = 0.0;
    openPorts = 0.0;
    activeServices = 0.0;
    unknownApplications = 0.0;
    malware = 0.0;
    total = 0.0;
  }

  public double getScore(Vulnerability vulnerability) {
    switch (vulnerability) {
      case MISSING_PATCHES:
        return missingPatches;
      case UNSECURED_SETTINGS:
        return unsecuredSettings;
      case WEAK_PASSWORDS:
        return weakPasswords;
      case OPEN_PORTS:
        return openPorts;
      case ACTIVE_SERVICES:
        return activeServices;
      case UNKNOWN_APPLICATIONS:
        return unknownApplications;
      case MALWARE:
        return malware;
      default:
        return 0.0;
    }
  }

  public double getTotalScore() {
    return total;
  }

  public void setScore(Vulnerability vulnerability, double score) {
    switch (vulnerability) {
      case MISSING_PATCHES:
        missingPatches = score;
        break;
      case UNSECURED_SETTINGS:
        unsecuredSettings = score;
        break;
      case WEAK_PASSWORDS:
        weakPasswords = score;
        break;
      case OPEN_PORTS:
        openPorts = score;
        break;
      case ACTIVE_SERVICES:
        activeServices = score;
        break;
      case UNKNOWN_APPLICATIONS:
        unknownApplications = score;
        break;
      case MALWARE:
        malware = score;
        break;
    }
    total = missingPatches + unsecuredSettings + weakPasswords + openPorts + activeServices + unknownApplications + malware;
  }
}
```

3. **Implement the scoring rules**:

```
public class WindowsSecurityScanner {
  private WindowsSystem system;

  public WindowsSecurityScanner(WindowsSystem system) {
    this.system = system;
  }

  public double scoreMissingPatches() {
    // Check the number of missing patches
    int patchCount = system.getMissingPatchCount();

    // Calculate the score based on the number of missing patches
    double score = 0.0;
    if (patchCount == 0) {
      score = 0.0;
    } else if (patchCount == 1) {
      score = 0.1;
    } else if (patchCount == 2) {
      score = 0.3;
    } else if (patchCount > 2) {
      score = 1.0;
    }

    return score;
  }

  public double scoreUnsecuredSettings() {
    // Check the number of unsecured settings
    int settingCount = system.getUnsecuredSettingCount();

    // Calculate the score based on the number of unsecured settings
    double score = 0.0;
    if (settingCount == 0) {
      score = 0.0;
    } else if (settingCount == 1) {
      score = 0.1;
    } else if (settingCount == 2) {
      score = 0.3;
    } else if (settingCount > 2) {
      score = 1.0;
    }

    return score;
  }

  public double scoreWeakPasswords() {
    // Check the number of weak passwords
    int passwordCount = system.getWeakPasswordCount();

    // Calculate the score based on the number of weak passwords
    double score = 0.0;
    if (passwordCount == 0) {
      score = 0.0;
    } else if (passwordCount == 1) {
      score = 0.1;
    } else if (passwordCount == 2) {
      score = 0.3;
    } else if (passwordCount > 2) {
      score = 1.0;
    }

    return score;
  }

  public double scoreOpenPorts() {
    // Check the number of open ports
    int portCount = system.getOpenPortCount();

    // Calculate the score based on the number of open ports
    double score = 0.0;
    if (portCount == 0) {
      score = 0.0;
    } else if (portCount == 1) {
      score = 0.1;
    } else if (portCount == 2) {
      score = 0.3;
    } else if (portCount > 2) {
      score = 1.0;
    }

    return score;
  }

  public double scoreActiveServices() {
    // Check the number of active services
    int serviceCount = system.getActiveServiceCount();

    // Calculate the score based on the number of active services
    double score = 0.0;
    if (serviceCount == 0) {
      score = 0.0;
    } else if (serviceCount == 1) {
      score = 0.1;
    } else if (serviceCount == 2) {
      score = 0.3;
    } else if (serviceCount > 2) {
      score = 1.0;
    }

    return score;
  }

  public double scoreUnknownApplications() {
    // Check the number of unknown applications
    int appCount = system.getUnknownApplicationCount();

    // Calculate the score based on the number of unknown applications
    double score = 0.0;
    if (appCount == 0) {
      score = 0.0;
    } else if (appCount == 1) {
      score = 0.1;
    } else if (appCount == 2) {
      score = 0.3;
    } else if (appCount > 2) {
      score = 1.0;
    }

    return score;
  }

  public double scoreMalware() {
    // Check for the presence of malware
    boolean hasMalware = system.hasMalware();

    // Calculate the score based on the presence of malware
    double score = 0.0;
    if (hasMalware) {
      score = 1.0;
    } else {
      score = 0.0;
    }

    return score;
  }
}
```

4. **Gather the data**:

```
public class WindowsSystem {
  public int getMissingPatchCount() {
    // Implement the logic to count the number of missing patches
  }

  public int getUnsecuredSettingCount() {
    // Implement the logic to count the number of unsecured settings
  }

  public int getWeakPasswordCount() {
    // Implement the logic to count the number of weak passwords
  }

  public int getOpenPortCount() {
    // Implement the logic to count the number of open ports
  }

  public int getActiveServiceCount() {
    // Implement the logic to count the number of active services
  }

  public int getUnknownApplicationCount() {
    // Implement the logic to count the number of unknown applications
  }

  public boolean hasMalware() {
    // Implement the logic to check for the presence of malware
  }
}
```

5. **Score the vulnerabilities**:

```
public class WindowsSecurityScanner {
  // ...

  public void score(Score score) {
    score.setScore(Vulnerability.MISSING_PATCHES, scoreMissingPatches());
    score.setScore(Vulnerability.UNSECURED_SETTINGS, scoreUnsecuredSettings());
    score.setScore(Vulnerability.WEAK_PASSWORDS, scoreWeakPasswords());
    score.setScore(Vulnerability.OPEN_PORTS, scoreOpenPorts());
    score.setScore(Vulnerability.ACTIVE_SERVICES, scoreActiveServices());
    score.setScore(Vulnerability.UNKNOWN_APPLICATIONS, scoreUnknownApplications());
    score.setScore(Vulnerability.MALWARE, scoreMalware());
  }
}
```

6. **Calculate the overall score**:

```
public class Score {
  // ...

  public double getTotalScore() {
    return total;
  }
}
```

7. **Report the results**:

```
public class WindowsSecurityScanner {
  // ...

  public void report(Score score) {
    System.out.println("Missing Patches: " + score.getScore(Vulnerability.MISSING_PATCHES));
    System.out.println("Unsecured Settings: " + score.getScore(Vulnerability.UNSECURED_SETTINGS));
    System.out.println("Weak Passwords: " + score.getScore(Vulnerability.WEAK_PASSWORDS));
    System.out.println("Open Ports: " + score.getScore(Vulnerability.OPEN_PORTS));
    System.out.println("Active Services: " + score.getScore(Vulnerability.ACTIVE_SERVICES));
    System.out.println("Unknown Applications: " + score.getScore(Vulnerability.UNKNOWN_APPLICATIONS));
    System.out.println("Malware: " + score.getScore(Vulnerability.MALWARE));
    System.out.println("Total Score: " + score.getTotalScore());
  }
}
```

Keep in mind that this is just a basic example, and there are many other ways to implement a security scoring system for a Windows operating system. Depending on your specific needs, you may want to consider using other classes, libraries, and tools.

To use the scoring system, you will need to do the following:

1. **Install the scoring system**: Install the scoring system on the Windows operating system that you want to score.
2. **Run the scoring system**: Run the scoring system to gather the data and calculate the scores.
3. **Review the results**: Review the results and use them to inform your decision-making.
4. **Adjust the settings as needed**: Based on your review of the results, you may want to adjust the settings of the system to better mitigate the vulnerabilities.
5. **Repeat the process**: Continue to use the scoring system on a regular basis to stay up-to-date on the vulnerabilities of the Windows operating system and to identify areas for improvement.
