To create an application that captures the IP address when someone hacks your computer, you need to follow these steps. This process requires basic network programming knowledge and the Python programming language. Here, I will provide an example Python code and explanation.

1. **Install the necessary libraries**:
   First, install the necessary libraries.
   ```bash
   pip install scapy
   pip install requests
   ```

2. **Write the Python code**:
   Write the code to detect hacking attempts and capture IP addresses.

   ```python
   from scapy.all import *
   import requests

   def packet_callback(packet):
       # Check if it's an IP packet
       if packet.haslayer(IP):
           ip_src = packet[IP].src
           ip_dst = packet[IP].dst
           print(f"[+] Captured IP packet: {ip_src} -> {ip_dst}")
           
           # Save the hacker's IP address to a file
           with open("captured_ips.txt", "a") as f:
               f.write(f"Source: {ip_src}, Destination: {ip_dst}\n")

           # Send the hacker's IP address to a specific server
           data = {'source_ip': ip_src, 'destination_ip': ip_dst}
           requests.post("http://your-server-url.com/log_ip", data=data)

   # Set the network interface
   sniff(prn=packet_callback, store=0)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       print("Capturing packets...")
   ```

3. **Security settings**:
   - For securely transmitting and storing captured IP addresses, use HTTPS on the server-side and add authentication.
   - Configure the `requests.post` part to include the server URL and a security token to ensure only authenticated requests are accepted.

4. **Server setup**:
   - Set up a server to store the captured IP addresses. You can use a web framework like Flask.

     ```python
     from flask import Flask, request

     app = Flask(__name__)

     @app.route("/log_ip", methods=["POST"])
     def log_ip():
         source_ip = request.form.get("source_ip")
         destination_ip = request.form.get("destination_ip")
         with open("server_captured_ips.txt", "a") as f:
             f.write(f"Source: {source_ip}, Destination: {destination_ip}\n")
         return "IP Logged", 200

     if __name__ == "__main__":
         app.run(ssl_context=('cert.pem', 'key.pem'))
     ```

Now, you can use this code to create an application that detects hacking attempts and captures IP addresses.

**Note**: It's important to seek proper legal advice to address any legal issues and ensure privacy protection when using this in a real-world scenario.
