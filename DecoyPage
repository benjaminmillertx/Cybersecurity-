To create a website that captures the IP addresses of visitors, you will need to do the following:

1. Create a new website project using your preferred programming language and web framework.
2. Design the user interface of the website, including any forms or elements that will be used to capture the IP addresses.
3. Implement the server-side code to capture the IP addresses of incoming requests and store them in a database or file.
4. Implement the client-side code to send the IP addresses to the server when the user interacts with the website.

Here is an example of how you might write the server-side code to capture the IP addresses of visitors using the `express` and `morgan` libraries in Node.js:

<script>
// Import the `express` and `morgan` libraries
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');

// Create an instance of the `express` app
const app = express();

// Add the `morgan` logging middleware to the app
app.use(morgan('combined'));

// Define the `/` route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
// Send a response to the client
res.send('Welcome to our website!');

// Log the IP address of the client
console.log(req.ip);
});
</script>

In this example, the `morgan` logging middleware is added to the `express` app, and it logs the IP addresses and other information about incoming requests to the console. You can customize the logging format and output location to suit your needs.

Here is an example of how you might write the client-side code to send the IP addresses to the server using the `fetch` API in JavaScript:

<script>
// Send a request to the server to capture the IP address
fetch('/').then(() => {
// Do something else on the page
});
</script>

In this example, the `fetch` function is used to send a request to the server when the page is loaded. The server logs the IP address of the client, and the client can continue to use the page as desired.

It is important to note that capturing IP addresses is subject to data protection and privacy laws, and it may require the consent of the data subjects. It is generally not advisable to capture or store PII without a legitimate purpose and without the consent of the data subjects.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
